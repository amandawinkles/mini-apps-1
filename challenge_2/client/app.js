//submit JSON data to the server, receive a response containing a CSV-formatted result (the way this is done will vary depending on where you are in the challenge)
//When the user clicks submit, POST the form data to the server.

//Initially, submission of the JSON data (from the client to server) should be done using an HTML form with a single textarea input field (for the entire JSON text) and a submit button. When the user clicks submit, POST the form data to the server. The form submission process should use the default browser action/behavior. DO NOT use jQuery/AJAX functions in the submission process.
